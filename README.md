## About

A software development volunteer opportunity to work alongside a KSU physics professor to create a physics simulation available online for students and professors. The program was created mainly through base JavaScript for the purpose of portability and ease-of-access in an online platform. The purpose of the tool is to demonstrate the trajectory of a projectile, with emphasis on being used as a teaching tool for the subject of kinematics.
