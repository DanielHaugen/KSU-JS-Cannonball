## About

Volunteer opportunity to worked with a KSU physics professor, during my senior year of high school, to create a physics simulation available online for students and professors. The purpose is to demonstrate the trajectory of a projectile, with emphasis on being used as a teaching tool for the subject of kinematics. The program is developed primarily in JavaScript, with HTML as the backbone for the webpage.
